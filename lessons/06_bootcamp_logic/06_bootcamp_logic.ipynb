    "To continue our box metaphor with variables (variable names refer to boxes, which store the variable contents inside), we can think of logical comparisons as 'picking up different boxes and comparing their contents'. Let's try some out and see:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "a = 0\n",
    "b = 1\n",
    "c = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f'is a equal to b?: {a==b}')\n",
    "print(f'is a not equal to b?: {a!=b}')\n",
    "print(f'is a greater than b?: {a>b}')\n",
    "print(f'is a less than b?: {a<b}')\n",
    "print(f'is b greater than or equal to c?: {b>=c}')\n",
    "print(f'is b greater less or equal to c?: {b<=c}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We get a Boolean `True` or `False` for each condition:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "is a equal to b?: False\n",
    "is a not equal to b?: True\n",
    "is a greater than b?: False\n",

    "One thing to mention here is that the number of spaces before/after the double equals sign don't *really* matter, as long as the code is on the same line and easy to read. Good to stay consistent though. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Equals signs (`=` vs. `==`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering about the double equals sign here. That's normal! This can be very confusing at first, but in python we ALWAYS use **a single equals sign for variable assignment** and **double equals signs to compare whether two variables are equal**. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is assigning the value of `2` to the variable named `a`. But if we do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(a == 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will evaluate whether the variable `a` stores a quantity equal to 2. (i.e. we are 'checking inside the box' to see whether 2 is in there). The return will either be the answer `True` or `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing integers and floats with another\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to know about logic with numeric data types (integers and floats), is that mathematical properties are obeyed. So, an integer and a float with the same mathematical value will be found equal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(3 == 3.00000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even though integers and floats represent the data differently under the hood, python knows they have the same value for making math comparisons in this situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic with Boolean variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to logic in python, Boolean variables can be used mathematically such that:\n",
    "* `True` is equal to `1`\n",
    "* `False` is equal to `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check this by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(True == 1)\n",
    "print(True == 1.0000)\n",
    "print(True == 0)\n",
    "print(True > 0)\n",
    "print(False == 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",
    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these help us see that `True` is equivalent to the value 1 and `False` is equivalent to the value 0. In fact if we run the code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(3.5 + True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We get:\n",
    "```\n",
    "4.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as if we had added two numbers together. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, Boolean variables are NOT equal to strings with the same spelling:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(True == 'True')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gives us:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, we can see that booleans can be treated mathematically and compared with floats and integers, but they are not so directly comprable with string data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### String Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technically**, we can use ALL of the same logic in comparing strings as with integers, floats, and boolean data types. For example, we can check if two strings are equal to one another and see that case matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# make some string variables\n",
    "a = 'cat'\n",
    "b = 'cat'\n",
    "c = 'CAT'\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if they're equal to one another\n",
    "print(a == b)\n",
    "print(a == c)\n",
    "print(a != c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "So here, we get:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The string variables that have *exactly the same sequence of characters* are equal to one another, otherwise not. And, we can see that **python is case-sensitive**, so the case must match exactly for strings to be considered equal. **But**, things get a little tricky when we try to see whether one string is 'greater' than or 'less' than another. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('cat' > 'bat')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code evaluates to:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weird! Why?\n",
    "* Under the hood, python stores values for every single possible text character using a system called [Unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html). We won't go into this here, but python can compare the unicode values for any two characters or strings, and return `True` `False` based on this. For this reason, unless we are **really** sure we know what we want and how to do it, using `>` or `<` to compare strings may not be the most effective. \n",
    "* Comparing strings to integers/floats/booleans can be odd too for the same reasons. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(2 == '2')\n",
    "print(2 == '2.0')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "False\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, comparing strings to numeric data this way doesn't serve too many uses. "

    "## 2. Compound Logic (`or`, `and`, & `not`)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all the logic we've worked with has been based on a single comparison. But, we can put them together to make 'compound conditional' operations. Luckily, python gives use a way to do this with fairly user-friendly language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `or`\n",

    "\n",
    "### `and`\n",
    "\n",
    "With `and`, we get `True` **only if both conditions are true**. So, if we repeat the same code as the previous piece but with `and`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(2 < 3 and 4 < 3) # only the first is true here\n",
    "print(2 > 3 and 4 > 3) # only the second is true here\n",
    "print(2 > 3 and 4 < 3) # neither are true here\n",
    "print(2 < 3 and 4 > 3) # both are true here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the last one where both are true returns `True`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "False\n",
    "False\n",
    "False\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also see the same results by plugging in boolean variables themselves:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(True and False) # only the first is true here\n",
    "print(False and True) # only the second is true here\n",
    "print(False and False) # neither are true here\n",
    "print(True and True) # both are true here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "With `not`, this **reverses** whatever existing logical operation exists. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(not 2 > 3)\n",
    "print(not False)\n",
    "print(not True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This outputs:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Combining `and` and `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine these two statements like so:\n",

    "b = 2\n",
    "print(a < 10 and not a > b)\n",
